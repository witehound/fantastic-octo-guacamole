- A technical writing brief/proposal is an essential document that outlines the parameters and expectations of a technical writing project. Its primary purpose is to provide technical writers with a clear understanding of the project's scope, audience, and requirements, guiding them through the entire writing process.
- A well-written technical writing proposal should include the following key sections Introduction, Background, Deliverables and Timeline.
- Introduction: The introductory section provides a concise overview of the document, outlining its purpose, scope, intended audience, and goals. This section also provides information on the specific outcomes or results that the document aims to achieve.
- Background: This section provides additional context and background information on the project. It provides an explanation of why the document is needed, who it is intended for, and any related projects or initiatives.
- Deliverables: The deliverable section provides information on the specific materials or documents expected to be provided as part of the project, including any specific requirements or expectations. Additionally, this section states the expected length of the technical writing document.
- Timeline: Every technical writing project should be time-bound. The timeline section outlines the projectâ€™s time frame and deadlines for each deliverable.
